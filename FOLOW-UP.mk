# FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS

### 1 What libraries did you use? Why did you use them?
The libraries that I implemented in the project were Bootstrap to obtain designs for the cards and Angular Material to make the table.
### 2 If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
I would have implemented better designs on the cards and in the abstract part I would have looked for a way to implement the labels that come inside. I would also try to improve the consumption of the API and make a search engine for the cards (Not like the one that comes in Material Angular for the table)
### 3 Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
What was most difficult for me was consuming the API because I was not very familiar with how the Crossref page handles it.
### 4 Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
Making the Material table work and what I spent the most time on was researching how to make a search engine for the cards, from there I think I could have put in better designs but I had no idea what type of design I could have used.
